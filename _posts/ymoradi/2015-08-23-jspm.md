This blog post demonstrates JSPM installation & configuration.

If you've not used JSPM in your project already, then you've to do following steps to use our JavaScript repositories.


**What is jspm?**

JSPM provides you a module loader, based on ECMA 2015 standards & syntaxes. Using JSPM, you can develop your application based on ECMA 2015 modules specifications, no matter relying browser or server supports that feature or not.

jspm combines followings:

* Package management: It has its own package manager + it has a well-defined integration with other package managers such as npm. It can also retrieve whatever we need from GitHub repositories directly if any.
 
* Module loader: It has its own ECMA 2015 based module loader. Plus, it is compatible with AMD, CommonJS module loaders.
 
* Transpiler: It configures Babel or other transpilers into your project. This gives you an ability to use almost all new ECMA features on browsers without native support of those features.
 
* Gives you an ability to define production Workflow.


**How to install jspm?**

To install jspm, you've to install nodejs first. 

Then, you should install jspm from command prompt using npm as following:

        npm install jspm -g

Then run the following command in the root folder of your project to install jspm locally:

        npm install jspm -save-dev

Then Run this command, again in root folder of your project to initialize jspm:

        jspm init

after answering to jspm init questions with default values (just press enter), then it will do these for you:
 
* It creates a package.json if not any.

* It creates a config.js file. This is the configuration file for jspm itslef.

* It configures babel for you as the transpiler.

Finally run the last commnd to download required packages into your project:

        jspm install


**Start Development**

Create an index.js and an index.html file.

Use following scripts in your index.html file:
 
{% gist 854f91e8e71de2c56738 %}

Then write following codes in your index.js:

{% gist 10ae73088e3cbe83eb84 %}

You can use almost all new ECMA features in your codes. 

To make this work, you should install a jspm package named linq4es2015 using the following command:

        jspm install linq4es2015


To get additional packages you can use following approaches:

        jspm install github:Fermium-co/LINQ4ES2015 

This will install linq4es2015 from its Github releases.

        jspm install npm:jasmine

This will install jasmine from npm packages. 

Note: jspm uses github to download most of packages, and GitHub introduces some limitation for anonymous requests.

If youâ€™ve GitHub account, configure your jspm with your account by running this command:

        jspm registry config github

and follow steps.
