LINQ 4 (for) ES 2015, is a library developed in modern ECMA world, based on bleeding edge features and libraries, primarily [Generator Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*).

There are lots of new opportunities because of new ECMA features, and in Fermium, we’re going to use all of them.

LINQ4ES2015, lets you develop complex queries in JavaScript world, based on .NET LINQ to Object specifications.

It has its own  wiki, tests, method description and samples, plus jspm registry package.

By now, it is supported only on applications which are based on babel transpiler, but Typescript support will be added soon.
